Runs **rekordbox 7.2.x** on Linux with a **Pioneer DDJ-400**, including
**PC MASTER OUT** — audio to the controller and the computer's speakers at once.

Ten Wine patches and a launcher that applies and verifies them.

> **rekordbox is not included** — it is proprietary. The launcher downloads it
> from rekordbox.com for you; you sign in with your own AlphaTheta account.

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| Distribution | **Arch**, **Debian trixie**, **Fedora 43** — see [Debian and Fedora](#debian-and-fedora) for the Wine each one needs. |
| Architecture | x86_64 |
| Wine | **wine-staging**, currently **11.16**. Plain `wine` is untested. |
| GPU | Tested on Intel Iris Xe. Nvidia and AMD untested here. |
| Controller | DDJ-400 for the controller and PC MASTER OUT claims. Other hardware untested. |
| Player | XDJ-XZ — reads back an exported stick in USB mode, and streams over PRO DJ LINK on the router LAN (T02, T15). No other player tested. |
| Root needed | Only to install the package and replug/reboot for the udev and module rules. |

## Install

Arch, one line:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrNorm/rekordbox-wine/master/bin/install.sh | bash
```

Picks the release built for your wine-staging version, checks it against the
release's `SHA256SUMS`, and installs it. If no build matches your Wine it stops
and tells you, rather than installing something that cannot work.

Then:

```sh
rekordbox-wine --install     # downloads rekordbox and installs it
rekordbox-wine               # launch
```

Prefer to read it first? `bin/install.sh` is in this repository — download it,
read it, run it.

### Build from source

Compiles the Wine components against the Wine you have. 20–30 minutes. Needed if
no release matches your Wine.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MrNorm/rekordbox-wine.git
cd rekordbox-wine/packaging
makepkg -si
```

The package version records the commit it was built from
(`0.2.0.r<commits>.g<short-sha>`). To update: `git pull`, then `makepkg -si`.

`paru` installs from AUR or from package *files*, not from a local PKGBUILD
directory, so hand it the result: `paru -U rekordbox-wine-git-*.pkg.tar.zst`.

**Not on the AUR.** AUR pushes have been blocked over malware injection; this
project distributes from GitHub instead.

### Debian and Fedora

No prebuilt packages yet — build them, which takes the same 20–30 minutes:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MrNorm/rekordbox-wine.git
cd rekordbox-wine
packaging/build-deb.sh        # Debian/Ubuntu  -> ../rekordbox-wine_*.deb
packaging/build-rpm.sh        # Fedora         -> ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/*.rpm
```

Both are built, marker-checked inside the package and installed on their own
distributions by [`packages.yml`](.github/workflows/packages.yml) on every
packaging change.

**You need Wine from the [WineHQ repository](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/wikis/Download)**,
because the distribution's own Wine is too old for the patch series. Measured
2026-09-02:

| | own Wine | with WineHQ repo | |
|---|---|---|---|
| Debian trixie | 10.0 | **11.16** | works |
| Fedora 43 | 11.0 | **11.16** | works |
| Fedora 42 | 10.20 | 11.8 | too old |
| Fedora 41 | 10.15 | 10.18 | too old |

Install `winehq-staging` from that repository first. The launcher checks the
version on every start and refuses rather than running against a Wine the
components were not built for.

## Installing rekordbox itself

Neither command needs root. The rekordbox installer shows one language dialog —
press Return.

| command | behaviour |
|---|---|
| `rekordbox-wine --install` | asks which version, then installs |
| `rekordbox-wine --install --latest` | newest, no questions |
| `rekordbox-wine --install <file.exe>` | uses an installer you already have |
| `rekordbox-wine --fetch [dir]` | downloads only |

With no terminal — a script, CI, a hook — `--install` never prompts and takes
the newest.

The version prompt offers the current release plus any installer already on the
machine (download cache, working directory, `artifacts/`):

```
Which version?
  1) 7.2.18  (current release — download)
  2) 7.2.17  (already here — artifacts/Install_rekordbox_x64_7_2_17.exe)
```

**Only the current release is downloadable.** AlphaTheta publishes one installer
link; there is no archive page, and older CDN paths return 403. Anything else in
the list is a file already on your disk.

`bin/fetch-rekordbox.sh --list` shows what is available without downloading.

The launcher runs on every start and repairs drift: builds its private Wine tree,
installs the patched DLLs into the prefix, applies the audio settings PC MASTER
OUT needs, and corrects Wine's own menu entry.

`rekordbox-wine --check` reports all of it and changes nothing.

## DDJ-400 setup

Two one-off steps that need root or physical access:

- **Replug the controller**, so the installed udev rule applies.
- **Reboot, or `sudo modprobe -r snd_seq_dummy`.** Without this rekordbox binds
  an ALSA loopback instead of the controller.

`rekordbox-wine --check` reports whether either is outstanding.

## USB stick export and PRO DJ LINK

**Stick.** Two things, both per machine and neither done by the launcher yet.

Read access to the raw block node, from a udev rule. Wine's `mountmgr` opens
`/dev/sdX1` to read the filesystem, and reports the stick as NTFS when the open
fails:

```text
SUBSYSTEM=="block", KERNEL=="sd*", ENV{ID_BUS}=="usb", TAG+="uaccess"
```

Number it below 73, where systemd acts on the tag.

A drive letter in the prefix, with the raw node next to it — the letter alone is
not enough, because the filesystem type and the device are both read through the
node. The letter is arbitrary:

```bash
ln -s /run/media/you/DATA  "$WINEPREFIX/dosdevices/e:"   # the DOS drive
ln -s /dev/sda1            "$WINEPREFIX/dosdevices/e::"  # the raw node it is read from
```

**PRO DJ LINK.** Put the player on the router LAN and allow the LAN subnet
inbound; the player connects to the computer, not the other way round:

```bash
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="192.168.0.0/24" accept' --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
# undo: firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="192.168.0.0/24" accept' --permanent && firewall-cmd --reload
```

**Do not cable the player's USB port to the PC at the same time.** That port is
a USB network bridge, and it adds a second interface on the player's subnet,
which breaks streaming. `ip -br addr` should show **one** interface on your LAN.

## Troubleshooting

Run `rekordbox-wine --check` first. It names the problem in most cases.

| symptom | cause | fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Not launching` and a list of blockers | Wine was upgraded; the patched components are built for the old version | Rebuild — see [Wine updates](#wine-updates) |
| Starts, one frame, then frozen | Started through Wine's own menu entry, bypassing the patches | Use `rekordbox-wine`, or the entry marked *(via rekordbox-wine)* |
| Two menu entries, one broken | Wine regenerates its entry on install | The launcher corrects it on every start |
| Controller absent, or MIDI binds to something else | udev rule or `snd_seq_dummy` | [DDJ-400 setup](#ddj-400-setup) |
| Sample-rate list empty in Preferences | Audio driver is `winepulse`, which has no exclusive mode | `--check` reports the driver; it must be `alsa` |
| A sound device vanishes from PipeWire mid-session | WirePlumber 0.5.15 crashes in its own ALSA error handler | `systemctl --user restart wireplumber` |
| PC MASTER OUT stalls | `WasapiPolling` / `AudioBufferSize` | The launcher seeds both; `--check` verifies them |
| Stick listed, but "formatted with an unsupported file system" | The filesystem type is read from the raw node; without read access it is misreported as NTFS | [USB stick export](#usb-stick-export-and-pro-dj-link) |
| PRO DJ LINK: player never sees the computer | Firewall, or the player's USB port cabled to the PC | [PRO DJ LINK](#usb-stick-export-and-pro-dj-link) |

## Keeping it working

### rekordbox updates

Nothing to do. rekordbox updates itself inside the prefix and the launcher starts
the newest version it finds. No Wine component is tied to a rekordbox version.

The launcher names the version it starts:

```
ok    rekordbox 7.2.18 — measured; see docs/GOLD-STATUS.md
warn  rekordbox 7.3.0 has not been measured by this project
```

It warns and starts. Measured versions are listed in
[`upstream/supported-rekordbox.txt`](upstream/supported-rekordbox.txt).

### Wine updates

A Wine upgrade requires a rebuild. The patched components are compiled against
Wine's internal interfaces, which change between releases.

The launcher **refuses to start** on a mismatch and prints the commands:

```sh
/usr/share/rekordbox-wine/bin/build-patched-dlls.sh   # 20–30 min, no root
/usr/share/rekordbox-wine/bin/make-private-wine.sh
```

Or install a release built for your Wine, or hold Wine back:

```
# /etc/pacman.conf
IgnorePkg = wine-staging
```

Untested Wine versions need `RBW_ALLOW_UNTESTED_WINE=1` to build. Tested versions
are listed in [`upstream/patches/supported-wine.txt`](upstream/patches/supported-wine.txt).

**The two version lists behave differently.** An unlisted Wine cannot load, so
the launcher refuses. An unlisted rekordbox is only unmeasured, so it warns.

## What works

Every claim has a run id in [`docs/GOLD-STATUS.md`](docs/GOLD-STATUS.md).

- Renders and repaints. Stock Wine paints one frame and freezes.
- Library, waveforms, analysis, two decks at 1.00× real time.
- DDJ-400 exclusive-mode audio at 44100 Hz; jog wheels and LEDs.
- PC MASTER OUT with zero stream teardowns over 465 s.
- File menu and the view-mode selector that gates EXPORT mode.
- USB export, `export.pdb` checked outside Wine by `bin/pdbcheck.py` — and the
  stick read back by a real XDJ-XZ in USB mode, waveforms, BPM and key on both
  decks.
- PRO DJ LINK to an XDJ-XZ over the router LAN — the player browses the host's
  library and plays a track (T15).

Measured on wine-staging 11.15 with rekordbox 7.2.17/7.2.18. On 11.16, "launches
and repaints", the XDJ-XZ USB readback, and PRO DJ LINK over the router LAN have
been re-measured (2026-09-12).

## What is not proven

- **`bin/pdbcheck.py` checks `export.pdb` structurally** — page size, tables,
  ranges. The XDJ-XZ reading the stick (T02) is the evidence that a real player
  accepts it; it is not a check of every field in the database.
- **PRO DJ LINK has been proven from the player side only** — a real XDJ-XZ
  browsing and playing from this host (T15).
- **No full DDJ-400 performance pass** — pad modes, FX, filters, crossfader
  curve, headphone cue, hot cues.
- Latency is 512 samples (11.6 ms), the same as a DDJ-400 on Windows. Lower costs
  about one stream teardown every 330 s, because `AvSetMmThreadCharacteristics`
  is a stub in Wine.

## System impact

Six fixes are unix libraries and drivers that Wine cannot override per-prefix.
Instead of overwriting files owned by your `wine` package, the launcher builds a
private Wine tree on first run: ~16 MB of symlinks plus the six patched files.
Other Wine applications are unaffected.

```sh
/usr/share/rekordbox-wine/bin/verifyloaded.sh          # what rekordbox mapped
/usr/share/rekordbox-wine/bin/verifyloaded.sh <pid>    # any other Wine app
```

Reads `/proc/<pid>/maps`, so it reports what a process loaded rather than what is
on disk.

To remove: uninstall the package and delete `~/.local/share/rekordbox-wine`.

## Wine defects found

Twelve, ten fixed. Patches in [`upstream/patches/`](upstream/patches/).

| # | component | defect |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `dxgi` | `IDXGIOutput::WaitForVBlank` unimplemented — any JUCE 8 application paints one frame and freezes |
| 2 | `mmdevapi` | event-driven exclusive streams refused outright — no DJ controller usable |
| 3 | `winealsa` | exclusive-mode event signalled with no period free — 343 buffer refusals in 344 periods |
| 4 | `winealsa` | SysEx split across two USB transfers — the DDJ-400 never authenticates |
| 5 | `winex11` | popup menus handed to the window manager, which places them offscreen — no File menu, no EXPORT mode |
| 6 | `mountmgr` | removable drive with unknown media type reported as no media |
| 7 | `mountmgr` | `StorageDeviceProperty` faked: every device claims fixed media on a SCSI bus |
| 8 | `setupapi` | `SPDRP_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_OBJECT_NAME` is a NULL placeholder — a device cannot be matched to a drive letter |
| 9 | `mountmgr` | no `STORAGE\Volume` device node written, so SetupAPI enumerates no volumes |
| 10 | `wineusb` | no `\\.\HCDn` device object, so rekordbox's USB validation fails and it discards the controller |
| 11 | `avrt` | `AvSetMmThreadCharacteristics` is a stub — **won't fix**: granting real-time priority is fatal while the audio thread polls |
| 12 | `mmdevapi` | `RegisterAudioSessionNotification` returns `S_OK` and never calls back — **reported** |

One defect was ours: patch 2 widened the exclusive buffer to four periods,
rekordbox read that back via `GetBufferSize()` and used it as its audio block
size. Written up in
[`upstream/reports/NOTES-mmdevapi-buffer-widening.md`](upstream/reports/NOTES-mmdevapi-buffer-widening.md).

## CI

- **`build.yml`** — builds the package daily and per push against Arch's current
  wine-staging, and verifies the patch markers inside the built package.
- **`wine-watch.yml`** — checks Arch's wine-staging version daily and opens an
  issue when it is ahead of `supported-wine.txt`.
- **`release.yml`** — publishes a package per `v*` tag, Wine version in the asset
  name.
- **`aur.yml`** — manual dispatch, gated on a secret.

The rekordbox axis cannot be tested in CI: proprietary, 660 MB installer behind a
JavaScript download page, sign-in needs a real account.

## Documentation status

This repository is the only thing published. The WineHQ Bugzilla reports, the
WirePlumber report and the two AppDB submissions are written and **unfiled** —
[`docs/PUBLISHING.md`](docs/PUBLISHING.md) lists what each needs.

The `WaitForVBlank` report matters most: without that fix no JUCE 8 application
paints a second frame.

`bin/rbw` is the harness; run it with no arguments for the commands.

The hardest bug was broken open with **LBR call-graph profiling**
(`perf record -e cycles:u --call-graph lbr`, which needs no unwind information)
plus **hardware execute breakpoints** (`perf record -e mem:<addr>:x`) to count
how often one instruction in a stripped 100 MB binary ran. See
[`docs/investigation/THEMES/`](docs/investigation/THEMES/) T10.
